<h1 id = "about">About me</h1>
 <p>What is it to be a professional?</p>
 <p>Do you find it hard to manage staff, frameworks and everything that is required for a company?</p>
 <p>When I was a kid, I dreant of being a good businessman, not like a doctor or a pilot
 as others were dreaming that age.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, my dream came true. 
After much hard study and reading books I am ready for you to challenge my knowledge and skills in practice.</p>
<p>I have gained much knowledge in IT, frameworks and management areas. 
My good friends call me "big fish" in IT and business,
 probably not because I am too good with it, but because I am opened with helping others through bad times.
 </p> 
<p>On my site you will find out more about my life experience, education and the most important skills in your areas.</p>
